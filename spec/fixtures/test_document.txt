This is a test document for RSpec testing.

It contains multiple paragraphs to simulate a real document that would be processed by the application.

The document discusses various topics including:
- Knowledge graph extraction
- Document processing
- Text summarization
- Chunk creation

This content will be used to test the document import service, chunk service, and other components of the application.

The text is long enough to be split into multiple chunks during processing, which allows us to test the chunking functionality properly.

Additional content can be added here to make the document longer if needed for specific test scenarios.
